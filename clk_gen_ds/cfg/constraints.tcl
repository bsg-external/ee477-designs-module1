# constraints.tcl
#
# This file is where design timing constraints are defined for Genus and Innovus.
# There are multiple files in toplevels/common that define helper
# functions for setting up complex timing constraints and block constraints
# for components such ass bsg_comm_link, bsg_tag and bsg_clk_gen.
#

# TODO: add constraints here!
